## Who is this?
My name is Sam Hunley, and I help lead a data analytics team in the US Federal government. This website is currently very much "in progress". I hope to have it fully updated soon.

In the meantime, below you will find information about the tools/templates used to produce this site.


This is an example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
