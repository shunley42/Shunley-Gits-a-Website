      <description>Who is this? My name is Sam Hunley, and I help lead a data analytics team in the US Federal government. This website is currently very much &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo;. I hope to have it fully updated soon.
In the meantime, below you will find information about the tools/templates used to produce this site.
This is an example website for the blogdown package. The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>

      <description>Making Sense of USASpending Contracts Data The contract data from USASpending can be overwhelming to parse through. Each year contains millions of rows and hundreds of columns of data, making it difficult for anyone to dive into at first. To make it a bit easier, I wanted to run through a simple analysis I conducted using contracts data from FY18.
 A Couple Notes The first question that might come to mind is - why am I looking at FY 2018 data when we just kicked off FY 2020 (October 1, 2019)?</description>
